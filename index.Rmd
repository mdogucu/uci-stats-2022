## Statistics


- 61 million adults in the United States live with a disability



- 26 percent (one in 4) of adults in the United States have some type of disability.


- 4.6 percent of people with a disability have a vision disability with blindness or serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses.

## ADA

Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life.

**Ableism** is discrimination in favor of able-bodied people.

## Accessibility as Career Preparation

[Accessible Technology Skills Gap Report  by The Partnership on Employment & Accessible Technology (PEAT), 2018](https://www.peatworks.org/infographic-the-accessible-technology-skills-gap/)

84% of industry respondents say it is important or very important to their company to hire developers and designers with accessible technology skills.



60% said it was difficult or very difficult for their organization to find job candidates with accessibility skills. 0% said it was easy or very easy.



41% of companies consider accessibility certification credentials as a differentiator in hiring.

## Curriculum Goal

As educators, we have to ensure that the current and the next generation of data scientists, provide public-facing outputs (websites, analysis reports, etc.) that are accessible.


---

class: middle

## Learning Objectives

- Student should get familiar with American Disabilities Act. 
- Students should use at least one assistive technology (i.e. screen reader).
- Students should consider different representations of data.

---

class: middle

## Assistive Technology

- Assistive Technology is any form of technology (software, device) that helps people with disabilities perform certain activities. Examples:

- walking sticks
- wheel chairs
- screen readers

---

class: middle

## Screen reader


A screen reader is an assistive technology that supports blind or visually impaired people in using their computer. 

<!-- We can do a demo here-->

---

class: middle

Students can use screen reader on Windows and Mac

- If you are on a Windows machine go to Settings > Ease of Access > Narrator,and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.

- If you are on a Mac go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Voice Over > Enable Voice Over

### Resources

[Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) You can upload any image and in return get an image with colors that would be visible to color-blind people with specific color vision deficiency. 

[Okabe-Ito 2008](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/)  Color Universal Design. Color palette that is color-blind friendly.

[Okabe-Ito color-palette](https://mikemol.github.io/technique/colorblind/2018/02/11/color-safe-palette.html) Color codes for Okabe-Ito palette.

## Data Verbalization

### Alternate Text

- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- It is used in HTML pages. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 
- We can verbalize data via alternate text.

## (some) Chunk Options in R Markdown

<table align = "center">

<tr>

<td>echo = FALSE</td>
<td>hides the code</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td>warning = FALSE</td>
<td>hides warning</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>error = TRUE</td>
<td>renders despite errors and displays the error</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>fig.cap = "Some figure caption"</td>
<td>creates a figure caption</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>fig.align = "center"</td>
<td>centers the figure in the page</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>fig.alt = "Some alternate text for figure"</td>
<td>creates alternate text for figures</td>

### Manual Alternate Text

- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)

### Data Verbalization -  Automated

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(transmission = if_else(am == 0, "automatic", "manual"))
```


```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=4}
example_barplot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = transmission)) +
  geom_bar()
example_barplot
```

The automated alternate text for this plot is on the next slide.

class: middle

### Data Verbalization -  Automated


```{r echo=TRUE}
BrailleR::VI(example_barplot)
```

<hr>

Drawback of using `VI()` is that not every type of plot can be verbalized yet.

### Alternate Texts are Under Utilized in the Data Science Community

"Over the 3 years of TidyTuesday, there were 7,136 data viz tweets and only 215 (3%) of them had alt-text"

## Data Sonification

Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound. 

Examples:

[SAS Graphics Accelerator Examples](https://support.sas.com/software/products/graphics-accelerator/samples/index.html)

[SAS Graphics Accelerator Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sas-graphics-accelerator/ockmipfaiiahknplinepcaogdillgoko?hl=en)


R example:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sonify::sonify(1:10)
```

## Data Tactualization

Data tactulization refers to making data visualization in a form so that it can be touchable by fingers.

## When?


- Stats 5 - Seminar in Data Science

- ICS 80 - Introduction to Data Science

- Stats 295 - Scientific Computing with R


---

class: middle

## Important Take-Aways


-  Relevant to undergraduate and graduate curriculum

- Can be taught in language-specific and language-agnostic courses

- Students should be assessed on the practice of accessibility practices

- Students should be able to take away this knowledge to non-data specific courses.
