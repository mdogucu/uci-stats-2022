## Statistics


- 61 million adults in the United States live with a disability



- 26 percent (one in 4) of adults in the United States have some type of disability.


- 4.6 percent of people with a disability have a vision disability with blindness or serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses.

## ADA

Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life.

**Ableism** is discrimination in favor of able-bodied people.

## Accessibility as Career Preparation

[Accessible Technology Skills Gap Report  by The Partnership on Employment &amp; Accessible Technology (PEAT), 2018](https://www.peatworks.org/infographic-the-accessible-technology-skills-gap/)

84% of industry respondents say it is important or very important to their company to hire developers and designers with accessible technology skills.



60% said it was difficult or very difficult for their organization to find job candidates with accessibility skills. 0% said it was easy or very easy.



41% of companies consider accessibility certification credentials as a differentiator in hiring.

## Curriculum Goal

As educators, we have to ensure that the current and the next generation of data scientists, provide public-facing outputs (websites, analysis reports, etc.) that are accessible.


---

class: middle

## Learning Objectives

- Student should get familiar with American Disabilities Act. 
- Students should use at least one assistive technology (i.e. screen reader).
- Students should consider different representations of data.

---

class: middle

## Assistive Technology

- Assistive Technology is any form of technology (software, device) that helps people with disabilities perform certain activities. Examples:

- walking sticks
- wheel chairs
- screen readers

---

class: middle

## Screen reader


A screen reader is an assistive technology that supports blind or visually impaired people in using their computer. 

&lt;!-- We can do a demo here--&gt;

---

class: middle

Students can use screen reader on Windows and Mac

- If you are on a Windows machine go to Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Narrator,and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.

- If you are on a Mac go to System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Voice Over &gt; Enable Voice Over

### Resources

[Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) You can upload any image and in return get an image with colors that would be visible to color-blind people with specific color vision deficiency. 

[Okabe-Ito 2008](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/)  Color Universal Design. Color palette that is color-blind friendly.

[Okabe-Ito color-palette](https://mikemol.github.io/technique/colorblind/2018/02/11/color-safe-palette.html) Color codes for Okabe-Ito palette.

## Data Verbalization

### Alternate Text

- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- It is used in HTML pages. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 
- We can verbalize data via alternate text.

---

class: middle

### Manual Alternate Text

- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)

### Data Verbalization -  Automated




&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The automated alternate text for this plot is on the next slide.

class: middle

### Data Verbalization -  Automated



```r
BrailleR::VI(example_barplot)
```

```
## This is an untitled chart with no subtitle or caption.
## It has x-axis 'transmission' with labels automatic and manual.
## It has y-axis 'count' with labels 0, 5, 10 and 15.
## The chart is a bar chart with 2 vertical bars.
## Bar 1 is centered horizontally at automatic, and spans vertically from 0 to 19.
## Bar 2 is centered horizontally at manual, and spans vertically from 0 to 13.
```

&lt;hr&gt;

Drawback of using `VI()` is that not every type of plot can be verbalized yet.

### Alternate Texts are Under Utilized in the Data Science Community

"Over the 3 years of TidyTuesday, there were 7,136 data viz tweets and only 215 (3%) of them had alt-text"

[Canelón &amp; Hare, 2021 ](https://github.com/spcanelon/csvConf2021)

## Data Sonification

Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound. 

Examples:

[SAS Graphics Accelerator Examples](https://support.sas.com/software/products/graphics-accelerator/samples/index.html)

[SAS Graphics Accelerator Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sas-graphics-accelerator/ockmipfaiiahknplinepcaogdillgoko?hl=en)


R example:


```r
sonify::sonify(1:10)
```

## Data Tactualization

Data tactulization refers to making data visualization in a form so that it can be touchable by fingers.

## When?



- Stats 5 - Seminar in Data Science

- ICS 80 - Introduction to Data Science

- Stats 295 - Scientific Computing with R

class: middle

## Important Take-Aways


-  Relevant to undergraduate and graduate curriculum

- Can be taught in language-specific and language-agnostic courses

- Students should be assessed on the practice of accessibility practices

- Students should be able to take away this knowledge from non-data specific courses.
