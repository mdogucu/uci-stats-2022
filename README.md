## Abstract

With the urgent need for training a higher number of skilled data scientists, many institutes of higher education are developing their own data science curricula and a consensus on what should be included in such curricula has not yet been reached. In the latest version of *Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Curricula* by ACM Data Science Task Force, accessibility is a recommended content for the data science curricula. In this talk, we will discuss teaching accessibility as part of the data science curriculum. The examples will mainly be shaped around using R, however, instructors using a different set of language(s) or even teaching languageagnostic courses may still find the content applicable for their own courses.
